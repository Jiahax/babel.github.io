If you didn't know already, we're planning on releasing a 7.0 version soon! I'd like to go over some notable changes and a few things we are still working out!

> For more specific changes, please check out our upgrade guide (will be updated)!

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

### [#4315](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4315) Drop support for unmaintained Node versions: 0.10, 0.12, 5

Progress in OSS projects often comes at the cost of upgrading for its users. Because of this, we're always been hesitant in making the choice to introduce a major version bump/breaking changes. But by dropping Node v0.12, we can not only make a number of improvements to the codebase, but also upgrade dependencies and tools (ESLint, Yarn, Jest, Lerna, etc).

### [#5128](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/5128) Babel presets must export a function as the default export

To simplify things, we've decided to standardize on requiring presets be functions that return a Babel config object (rather than just an object).

Before (invalid in 7.0)

```js
export default {
  plugins: ['plugin-a']
};
```

After

```js
export default function() { // or module.exports
  return {
    plugins: ['plugin-a']
  };
}
```

## Meta

### [#5218](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5218) Remove `babel-runtime` from Babel dependencies

Babel itself doesn't have that many external dependencies, but in 6.x [each package has a dependency on `babel-runtime`](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/958f72ddc28e2f5d02adf44eadd2b1265dd0fa4d/packages/babel-plugin-transform-es2015-arrow-functions/package.json#L12) so that built-ins like Symbol, Map, Set, and others are available without needing a polyfill. By changing the minimum supported version of Node to v4 (where those built-ins are supported natively), we can drop the dependency entirely.

> This is an issue on npm 2 (we didn't recommended it's use with Babel 6) and older yarn, but not npm 3 due to its deduping behavior.

With [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) the size of the node_modules folder changed drastically when babel-runtime was hoisted.

- `node_modules` for npm 3: ~120MB
- `node_modules` for Yarn (<`0.21.0`): ~587MB
- `node_modules` for Yarn (<`0.21.0`) with hoisted `babel-runtime`: ~157MB
- `node_modules` for Yarn + [PR #2676](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/2676): 118MB

So although this issue is fixed "upstream" by using npm 3/latest Yarn, we can simply drop all our own dependencies on `babel-runtime`.
